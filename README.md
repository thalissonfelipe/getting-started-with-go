# Getting Started with Golang

This repository contains examples of codes written in go using the TDD (Test-driven Development) approach. All codes here were created according to the [Learn Go with Tests](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/) tutorial. Besides go being a new language for me, it was also my first TDD experience.
